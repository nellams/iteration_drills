Introduction

In this challenge, we will drill iteration concepts using .each for arrays, hashes and compound data structures.

Turning .each into English

example

# cities is an array
cities.each do |city|
  puts city
end
answer

For every element called 'city' in the array 'cities', print out 'city'

Turning English into .each

example

For every element 'number' in the array 'numbers' print out the number.

answer

numbers.each do |number|
  puts number
end

Arrays

Consider the following array:
array = [28214, 63061, 49928, 98565, 31769, 42316, 23674, 3540, 34953, 70282, 22077, 94710, 50353, 17107, 73683, 33287, 44575, 83602, 33350, 46583]
Write Ruby code to find out the answers to the following questions:

What is the sum of all the numbers in array?
How would you print out each value of the array?
What is the sum of all of the even numbers?
What is the sum of all of the odd numbers?
What is the sum of all the numbers divisble by 5?
What is the sum of the squares of all the numbers in the array?

Consider the following array:

array = ["joanie", "annamarie", "muriel", "drew", "reva", "belle", "amari", "aida", "kaylie", "monserrate", "jovan", "elian", "stuart", "maximo", "dennis", "zakary", "louvenia", "lew", "crawford", "caitlyn"]
Write Ruby code to find out the answers to the following questions:

How would you print out each name backwards in array?
What are the total number of characters in the names in array?
How many names in array are less than 5 characters long?
How many names in array end in a vowel?
How many names in array are more than 5 characters long?
How many names in array are exactly 5 characters in length?
